I'm super happy to announce *Purchasing Parity Power* on [Dracula PRO](/pro)!

Why? Because not **everyone earns in dollars**.

Now 160 countries have unique discounts based on their currency value and social climate ðŸ’š

It took me an entire Saturday, but I managed to build my own solution using Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, and Gumroad. If you're interested in implementing something like this too, I shared some resources that were useful to me on Twitter.

I just added the Portuguese and Spanish versions of my book 14 Habits of Highly Productive Developers into the Dracula PRO package. Enjoy ;)

Happy hacking!
