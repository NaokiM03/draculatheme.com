The wait is over... [Dracula PRO is live](/pro)!

This is a very special moment for me. It's been almost 7 years since I launched Dracula, and I'm super excited about this next step.

The original colors created in 2013 were based on personal taste. This new PRO version brings a more refined and mathematical approach that **normalizes lightness and saturation**.

Dracula PRO comes with 6 theme variations for 10 different apps such as Alfred, Hyper, iTerm, JetBrains IDEs, Slack, Sublime Text, Terminal.app, Visual Studio Code, XCode, and ZSH.

Plus, 4 hand-picked fonts with ligatures and a screencast with my personal productivity tips.

On top of that, I'm also working on an e-book about the habits of highly productive developers, which will be released in Q2 2020.

I put a lot of energy to prepare all this for you and I hope you love Dracula PRO as much as I do.

Thanks for your support over the years!
