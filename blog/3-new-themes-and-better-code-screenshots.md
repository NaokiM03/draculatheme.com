Last time we saw each other I was telling you all about this new book I wrote. The launch was amazing, it reached #1 Best-Seller on Amazon, and I couldn't be happier with the reception.

Enough about the book. Let's talk about Dracula! I was recently interviewed by one of my favorite podcasts, The Changelog, to tell the journey of Dracula PRO. If you like podcasts, listen now - It's OK to make money from your open source.

The Dracula community surprises me every day. Recently, a Reddit user shared his Dracula setup on r/unixporn. It looks rad, doesn't it? In case you want to replicate, he shared the full list of configurations there.

## New on Dracula PRO

Do you know those beautiful code screenshots that people share on social media? Let me tell you a secret... they are all created using this super cool tool called Carbon.

I recently worked with their team, and we have some news to share. You can now generate good-looking screenshots using [Dracula PRO colors on Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/?t=dracula-pro).
