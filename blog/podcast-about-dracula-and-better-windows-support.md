It's been a crazy couple of weeks. I have to admit I'm a little bit overwhelmed with all that's happening in the world but, hey, the show must go on. For the next two weeks, I'll be [working from home](https://twitter.com/zenorocha/status/1239558074693632002), how about you? Are you enjoying the remote work life?

Ok, let's talk about Dracula... Recently I've been [interviewed on the Sustain Podcast](https://sustain.codefund.fm/27) about open source monetization. It was a really nice conversation, and I think you'll like it too.

## New on Dracula PRO

When I launched the PRO version, I didn't have time to focus on different OS's. Now I'm spending more time on them, especially on Windows.

This past week I added two new themes to Dracula PRO:

* [Notepad++](/notepad-plus-plus)
* [Windows Terminal](/windows-terminal)

Have a good quarantine!
